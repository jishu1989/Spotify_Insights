# Spotify Insights  

## Objective

The goal of this project is to write a script that fetch tracks from any Spotify playlist, as well as the metadata and the audio features for these tracks. As a test case, we will fetch the tracks and their associated metadata from the following playlist: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2km2nHDVADmnQMhQRaTOEL?si=fMi8UPf6QLqvhsTn_2mdwA . Since we use spotipy python library for the case, we use python as a programming language to call the API and design the pipeline.
