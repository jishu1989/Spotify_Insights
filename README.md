# Spotify Insights  

## Objective

The goal of this project is to write a script that fetch tracks from any Spotify playlist, as well as the metadata and the audio features for these tracks. As a test case, we will fetch the tracks and their associated metadata from the following playlist: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2km2nHDVADmnQMhQRaTOEL?si=fMi8UPf6QLqvhsTn_2mdwA . Since we use spotipy python library for the case, we use python as a programming language to call the API and design the pipeline.

## Libraries and functions

**Spotipy**: lightweight Python library for the Spotify Web API. Spotipy you get full access to all of the music data provided by the Spotify platform.  
**load_dotenv**: is a helper function from the python-dotenv package.It loads environment variables from a ```.env``` file into your Python program so you don’t hard-code secrets like API keys.  
**SpotifyOAuth**: allows your script to log in to Spotify, get an access token, refresh it, and make API calls without you doing the low-level OAuth work.  
**os**:  
**csv**:
